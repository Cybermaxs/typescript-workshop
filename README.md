Typescript workshop
====
_Warning this is a work in progress_
The objective of this workshop is to teach you Typescript language through testing & simples tasks.

Prerequisites & Getting Started
---
- install node
- install typescript compiler as a global module (`npm install -g typescript`)
- install/open the root folder with a editor like Visual Studio Code

How to
---
for each task, you will find a README.md file containing a short intro, exercices details, some help (link to docs), .. and expectations. 
Expectations could be :
- run a command
- use intellisense and/or natigate to definition files
- transpile a ts to js, and review the produced file
- run a produced js file in node
- write test(s)

Tips
---
- follow the readme/todo
- use/abuse your editor intellisense/autocompletion
- review typescript compiler errors/warning
- do not hesitate to browse online resources
- NEVER change assertions/expectations : you job is to fix the failing test by writing _something_
