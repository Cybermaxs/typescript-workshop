02 - Working with Typescript
===
> Typescript : JavaScript that scales. Any browser. Any host. Any OS. Open Source.

TypeScript is a free and open source programming language developed and maintained by Microsoft. 
Everyone can join the community or simply use it. This not a MS-only stuff working only on Windows.
The language is now very popular and used by a lot of companies and frameworks (ionic, angular, ...).
As said previously, TypeScript compiles into JavaScript, what you are actually going to execute (either in the browser or on the server). 
So you are going to need the TypeScript compiler (tsc) or a TypeScript editor (VS, VS Code, WebStorm, Atom, ...).
It is also easy to integrate the compiler into your favorite build system (TFS, grunt, gulp, webpack, ...).

Instructions
---
- install the typescript compiler : `npm install typescript -g`
- check installation with `tsc -v`; it should be > 2.0.0 

**Congrats** you're ready to compile your first file !
