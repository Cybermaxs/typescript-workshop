01 - Understanding TypeScript
===
> Typescript is a _**typed**_ _**superset**_ of Javascript that _**compiles**_ to plain _**javascript**_.

Here are some explanations of the main ideas :
- typed : Typescript provides an optional type system. Types have proven ability to enhance code quality and understandability.
- superset : your javascript is typescript. ES201X, ES7 is also Typescript. 
- compiles : typescript files can't be executed directly in browser or on server(node). They have to be transpiled to javascript.
- javascript : it is still javascript and learning ts shouldn't prevent you to learn javascript.
